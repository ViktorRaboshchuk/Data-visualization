# Data-visualization

To have circles visualization on the map you odd to have xlsx file with coordinates, and sales numbers or what you want.


So this script takes information from yout xlsx file, and according to this information its drowing circles on the map(I chose Ukraine). 


And circles of every region bigger if sales is bigger, and circles are lower if sales are lower.
